# Clothing-classifier
A gui for my clothing image classifier, trained on the fashion-MNIST <br>
to run the program all you have to do is ``python start.py``
<br><br>
I do not recommend installing this software. As for now it is unstable and need additional packages to run (Keras, PyQt5, tensorflow)
